Some considerations:

-- BN models eximate all CPDs around 0.5 since there are no much data and cases and the network structure probably provides for very specific cases
-- RF models overfit since the target value is very often 0 less than 1 so the model learns to estimate 0 as target


SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS:
- Consider the overall changing diagnosis, not focusing on the single estimation of the changes in segments diagnosis
- Change the BN model in a overall network
- Try different approaches
